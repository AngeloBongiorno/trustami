In modern [[historiography]], '''ancient Rome''' is the [[Roman people|Roman]] civilisation from the [[founding of Rome|founding]] of the Italian city of [[Rome]] in the 8th century&amp;nbsp;BC to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century&amp;nbsp;AD. It encompasses the [[Roman Kingdom]] (753–509&amp;nbsp;BC), the [[Roman Republic]] (509{{nbnd}}27&amp;nbsp;BC), and the [[Roman Empire]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}}476&amp;nbsp;AD) until the fall of the western empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Ancient Rome |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome |access-date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|The specific dates vary, depending on whether one follows Roman tradition, modern archaeology, or competing views of which particular events mark endpoints.}}

Ancient Rome began as an [[Italic peoples|Italic]] settlement, traditionally dated to 753&amp;nbsp;BC, beside the [[River Tiber]] in the [[Italian Peninsula]]. The settlement grew into the city and polity of Rome, and came to control its neighbours through a combination of treaties and military strength. It eventually controlled the Italian Peninsula, assimilating the [[Greece|Greek]] culture of southern [[Italy]] ([[Magna Graecia]]) and the [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] culture, and then became the dominant power in the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. At its height it controlled the [[North Africa during Antiquity|North African]] coast, [[Egypt]], Southern Europe, and most of Western Europe, the [[Balkans]], [[Crimea]], and much of the Middle East, including [[Anatolia]], the [[Levant]], and parts of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Arabia]]. That empire was among the [[largest empires]] in the ancient world, covering around {{Convert|5|e6km2|e6sqmi|abbr=off}} in AD&amp;nbsp;117,&lt;ref name="Taagepera-1979"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taagepera|1979|p=125}}; {{Harvnb|Turchin|Adams|Hall|2006|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated 50 to 90&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants, roughly 20% of the world's population at the time.{{Efn|There are several different estimates for the population of the Roman Empire.

Ancient Rome is often grouped into [[classical antiquity]] together with [[ancient Greece]], and their similar cultures and societies are known as the [[Greco-Roman world]]. Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern language, religion, society, technology, law, politics, government, warfare, art, literature, architecture, and engineering. Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a system of government called {{lang|la|[[res publica]]}}, the inspiration for modern republics such as the [[United States]] and [[France]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Furet|1a2=Ozouf|1y=1989|1p=793|2a1=Luckham|2a2=White|2y=1996|2p=11|3a1=Sellers|3y=1994|3p=90}} It achieved impressive [[Ancient Roman technology|technological]] and [[Ancient Roman architecture|architectural]] feats, such as the empire-wide construction of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] and [[Roman roads|roads]], as well as more grandiose monuments and facilities.

Archaeological evidence of settlement around Rome starts to emerge {{Circa|1000&amp;nbsp;BC}}.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=519}} Large-scale organisation appears only {{Circa|800&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}, with the first graves in the [[Esquiline Hill]]'s necropolis, along with a [[murus Romuli|clay and timber wall]] on the bottom of the [[Palatine Hill]] dating to the middle of the 8th century&amp;nbsp;BC. Starting from {{Circa|650&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}, the Romans started to drain the valley between the [[Capitoline]] and Palatine Hills, where today sits the [[Roman Forum]].{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=29}} By the 6th century&amp;nbsp;BC, the Romans were constructing the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] on the Capitoline and expanding to the [[Forum Boarium]] located between the Capitoline and [[Aventine Hill]]s.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=31}}

The Romans themselves had a [[founding myth]], attributing their city to [[Romulus and Remus]], offspring of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and a princess of the mythical city of [[Alba Longa]].{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|pp=31–32}} The sons, sentenced to death, were rescued by a wolf and returned to restore the Alban king and found a city. After a dispute, Romulus killed Remus and became the city's sole founder. The area of his initial settlement on the Palatine Hill was later known as [[Roma quadrata]] ('Square Rome'). The story dates at least to the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC, and the later Roman antiquarian [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] placed the city's foundation to 753&amp;nbsp;BC.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=32}} Another legend, recorded by Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], says that Prince Aeneas led a group of Trojans on a sea voyage to found a new Troy after the [[Trojan War]]. They landed on the banks of the [[Tiber River]] and a woman travelling with them, Roma, torched their ships to prevent them from leaving again. They named the settlement after her.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, Ronald and McGee Marni, ''The Ancient Roman World'' p. 15 (Cited 15 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman poet [[Virgil]] recounted this legend in his classical epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]''.

Literary and archaeological evidence is clear on there having been kings in Rome, attested in fragmentary 6th-century BC texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boatwright|2012|p=35|ps=. "{{lang|la|Rex}}, the Latin word for king, appears in two fragmentary sixth-century texts, one an inscription from the shrine of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], and the other a potsherd found in the [[Regia]]".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long after the abolition of the Roman monarchy, a vestigial {{lang|la|rex sacrorum}} was retained to exercise the monarch's former priestly functions. The Romans believed that their monarchy was elective, with seven legendary kings who were largely unrelated by blood.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=36}}

Evidence of Roman expansion is clear in the 6th century BC; by its end, Rome controlled a territory of some {{Convert|780|km2|mi2|abbr=off}} with a population perhaps as high as 35,000.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=36}} A palace, the [[Regia]], was constructed {{Circa|625&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}};{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=36}} the Romans attributed the creation of their first popular organisations and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to the regal period as well.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=37}} Rome also started to extend its control over its Latin neighbours. While later Roman stories like the ''[[Aeneid]]'' asserted that all Latins descended from the character [[Aeneas]],{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=39}} a common culture is attested to archaeologically.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=40}} Attested to reciprocal rights of marriage and citizenship between Latin cities—the {{lang|la|[[Jus Latii]]}}—along with shared religious festivals, further indicate a shared culture. By the end of the 6th century, most of this area had become dominated by the Romans.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=42}}

By the end of the 6th century BC, Rome and many of its Italian neighbours entered a period of turbulence. Archaeological evidence implies some degree of large-scale warfare.{{Sfn|Boatwright|2012|p=43}} According to tradition and later writers such as [[Livy]], the [[Roman Republic]] was established {{Circa|509&amp;nbsp;BC}},{{Sfn|Cornell|1995|pages=215 et seq}} when the last of the seven kings of Rome, [[Tarquin the Proud]], was [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|deposed]] and a system based on annually elected [[Roman Magistrate|magistrates]] and various representative assemblies was established.{{Sfn|Matyszak|2003|pages=43–44}} A [[constitution of the Roman Republic|constitution]] set a series of [[separation of powers|checks and balances]], and a [[separation of powers]]. The most important magistrates were the two [[Roman consul|consuls]], who together exercised executive authority such as {{lang|la|[[imperium]]}}, or military command.{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|pp=41–42}} The consuls had to work with the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], which was initially an advisory council of the ranking nobility, or [[patricians]], but grew in size and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hooker |first=Richard |date=6 June 1999 |title=Rome: The Roman Republic |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ROME/REPUBLIC.HTM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025151/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ROME/REPUBLIC.HTM |archive-date=14 May 2011 |publisher=Washington State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other magistrates of the Republic include [[tribune]]s, [[quaestor]]s, [[aedile]]s, [[praetor]]s and [[Roman censor|censors]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Magistratus.html Magistratus] by George Long, M.A. Appearing on pp. 723–724 of ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' by William Smith, D.

In the 4th century BC, Rome had come under attack by the [[Gauls]], who now extended their power in the Italian peninsula beyond the [[Po Valley]] and through Etruria. On 16 July 390&amp;nbsp;BC, a Gallic army under the leadership of tribal chieftain [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]], defeated the Romans at the [[Battle of the Allia]] and marched to Rome. The Gauls looted and burned the city, then laid siege to the Capitoline Hill, where some Romans had barricaded themselves, for seven months. The Gauls then agreed to give the Romans peace in exchange for 1000 pounds of gold.&lt;ref&gt;These are literally Roman {{lang|la|librae}}, from which the pound is derived.&lt;/ref&gt; According to later legend, the Roman supervising the weighing noticed that the Gauls were using false scales. The Romans then took up arms and defeated the Gauls. Their victorious general [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] remarked "With iron, not with gold, Rome buys her freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Camillus*.html] Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Camillus'', XXIX, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC Rome faced a new and formidable opponent: [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], the other major power in the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=25–26}}; {{Harvnb|Miles|2011|pp=175–176}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Punic War]] began in 264&amp;nbsp;BC, when the city of [[Messana]] asked for Carthage's help in their conflicts with [[Hiero II of Syracuse]].

Rome entered this war because [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and Messana were too close to the newly conquered Greek cities of Southern Italy and Carthage was now able to make an offensive through Roman territory; along with this, Rome could extend its domain over [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Cassius Dio – Fragments of Book 11 |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/11*.html |access-date=6 September 2022 |website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carthage was a maritime power, and the Roman lack of ships and naval experience made the path to the victory a long and difficult one for the [[Roman Republic]]. Despite this, after more than 20 years of war, Rome defeated Carthage and a peace treaty was signed. Among the reasons for the [[Second Punic War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=New historical atlas and general history |first=Robert Henlopen |last=Labberton |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the subsequent war reparations Carthage acquiesced to at the end of the First Punic War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Punic Wars|display=Punic Wars § The Interval between the First and Second Wars|volume=22|page=850|first=Maximilian Otto Bismarck|last=Caspari}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war began with the audacious invasion of Hispania by [[Hannibal]], who marched through [[Hispania]] to the Italian [[Alps]]. Hannibal's invasion lasted over 16 years, ravaging Italy, but ultimately Carthage was defeated in the decisive [[Battle of Zama]] in October 202&amp;nbsp;BC.

More than a half century after these events, Carthage was left humiliated and the Republic's focus was now directed towards the [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms of Greece and [[Celtiberian Wars|revolts in Hispania]]. However, Carthage, having paid the war indemnity, felt that its commitments and submission to Rome had ceased, a vision not shared by the [[Roman Senate]]. The [[Third Punic War]] began when Rome declared war against Carthage in 149&amp;nbsp;BC. Carthage resisted well at the first strike but could not withstand the attack of [[Scipio Aemilianus]], who entirely destroyed the city, enslaved all the citizens and gained control of that region, which became the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. All these wars resulted in Rome's first overseas conquests (Sicily, Hispania and Africa) and the rise of Rome as a significant imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haywood|1971|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientworld0000unse/page/376 376]–393}}; {{Cite web |last=Hooker |first=Richard |date=6 June 1999 |title=Rome: The Punic Wars |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ROME/PUNICWAR.HTM |access-date=22 March 2007 |website=Washington State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign dominance led to internal strife.

Violent gangs of the urban unemployed, controlled by rival Senators, intimidated the electorate through violence. The situation came to a head in the late 2nd century&amp;nbsp;BC under the [[Gracchi]] brothers, a pair of [[tribune]]s who attempted to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major patrician landholdings among the plebeians. Both brothers were killed and the Senate passed reforms reversing the Gracchi brother's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tuma |first=Elias H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmZHKOHgvFQC |title=Twenty-six Centuries of Agrarian Reform: A Comparative Analysis |date=1965 |publisher=University of California Press |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the growing divide of the plebeian groups ({{lang|la|[[populares]]}}) and equestrian classes ({{lang|la|[[optimates]]}}).

[[Gaius Marius]] soon became a leader of the Republic, holding the first of his seven consulships (an unprecedented number) in 107&amp;nbsp;BC by arguing that his former patron [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus]] was not able to defeat and capture the Numidian king [[Jugurtha]]. Marius then started his military reform: in his recruitment to fight Jugurtha, he levied the very poor (an innovation), and many landless men entered the army. Marius was elected for five consecutive consulships from 104 to 100&amp;nbsp;BC, as Rome needed a military leader to defeat the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutones]], who were threatening Rome. After Marius's retirement, Rome had a brief peace, during which the Italian {{lang|la|socii}} ('allies') requested Roman citizenship and voting rights. The reformist [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Marcus Livius Drusus]] supported their legal process but was assassinated, and the {{lang|la|socii}} revolted against the Romans in the [[Social War (91-88&amp;nbsp;BC)|Social War]].

By the end of the Social War, Marius and Sulla were the premier military men in Rome and their partisans were in conflict, both sides jostling for power. In 88&amp;nbsp;BC, Sulla was elected for his first consulship and his first assignment was to defeat [[Mithridates VI]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], whose intentions were to conquer the Eastern part of the Roman territories. However, Marius's partisans managed his installation to the military command, defying Sulla and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. To consolidate his own power, Sulla conducted a surprising and illegal action: he marched to Rome with his legions, killing all those who showed support to Marius's cause. In the following year, 87&amp;nbsp;BC, Marius, who had fled at Sulla's march, returned to Rome while Sulla was campaigning in Greece. He seized power along with the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] and killed the other consul, [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]], achieving his seventh consulship. Marius and Cinna revenged their partisans by conducting a massacre.&lt;ref name="William Harrison De Puy-1893"&gt;{{Cite book |last=William Harrison De Puy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGxJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA760 |title=The Encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature; the R.

Marius died in 86&amp;nbsp;BC, due to age and poor health, just a few months after seizing power. Cinna exercised absolute power until his death in 84&amp;nbsp;BC. After returning from his Eastern campaigns, Sulla had a free path to reestablish his own power. In 83&amp;nbsp;BC he made his [[Sulla's civil war|second march on Rome]] and began a time of terror: thousands of nobles, knights and senators were executed. Sulla held two [[Roman dictator|dictatorships]] and one more consulship, which began the crisis and decline of Roman Republic.&lt;ref name="William Harrison De Puy-1893" /&gt;

==== Caesar and the First Triumvirate ====
[[File:Landing of the Romans on the Coast of Kent.jpg|thumb|Landing of the Romans in [[Kent]], 55&amp;nbsp;BC: Caesar with 100 ships and two legions made an opposed landing, probably near [[Deal, Kent|Deal]]. After pressing a little way inland against fierce opposition and losing ships in a storm, he retired back across the [[English Channel]] to Gaul from what was a reconnaissance in force, only to return the following year for a more serious [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasion]].]]

In the mid-1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, Roman politics were restless. Political divisions in Rome split into one of two groups, {{lang|la|[[populares]]}} (who hoped for the support of the people) and {{lang|la|[[optimates]]}} (the 'best', who wanted to maintain exclusive aristocratic control). Sulla overthrew all populist leaders and his constitutional reforms removed powers (such as those of the [[tribune of the plebs]]) that had supported populist approaches. Meanwhile, social and economic stresses continued to build; Rome had become a metropolis with a super-rich aristocracy, debt-ridden aspirants, and a large proletariat often of impoverished farmers. The latter groups supported the [[Catilinarian conspiracy]]—a resounding failure since the consul [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] quickly arrested and executed the main leaders.

[[Julius Caesar]] reconciled the two most powerful men in Rome: [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], who had financed much of his earlier career, and Crassus' rival, [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (anglicised as Pompey), to whom he married [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|his daughter]]. He formed them into a new informal alliance including himself, the [[First Triumvirate]] ('three men'). Caesar's daughter died in childbirth in 54&amp;nbsp;BC, and in 53&amp;nbsp;BC, Crassus invaded [[Parthia]] and was killed in the [[Battle of Carrhae]]; the Triumvirate disintegrated. Caesar [[Gallic Wars|conquered Gaul]], obtained immense wealth, respect in Rome and the loyalty of battle-hardened legions. He became a threat to Pompey and was loathed by many {{lang|la|optimates}}. Confident that Caesar could be stopped by legal means, Pompey's party tried to strip Caesar of his legions, a prelude to Caesar's trial, impoverishment, and exile.

To avoid this fate, Caesar [[crossed the Rubicon]] River and invaded Rome in 49&amp;nbsp;BC. The [[Battle of Pharsalus]] was a brilliant victory for Caesar and in this and other campaigns, he destroyed all of the ''optimates'' leaders: [[Metellus Scipio]], [[Cato the Younger]], and Pompey's son, [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (son of Pompey)|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]]. Pompey was murdered in Egypt in 48&amp;nbsp;BC. Caesar was now pre-eminent over Rome: in five years he held four consulships, two ordinary dictatorships, and two special dictatorships, one for perpetuity. He was murdered in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, on the [[Ides of March]] by the ''[[Liberatores]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/caesar_julius.shtml Julius Caesar (100–44 BC)]. BBC. Retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Octavian and the Second Triumvirate ====
Caesar's assassination caused political and social turmoil in Rome; the city was ruled by his friend and colleague, [[Mark Antony]]. Soon afterward, [[Augustus|Octavian]], whom Caesar adopted through his will, arrived in Rome. Octavian (historians regard Octavius as Octavian due to the [[Roman naming conventions]]) tried to align himself with the Caesarian faction. In 43&amp;nbsp;BC, along with Antony and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], Caesar's best friend,&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html] Plutarch, Life of Caesar. Retrieved 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; he legally established the [[Second Triumvirate]]. Upon its formation, 130–300 senators were executed, and their property was confiscated, due to their supposed support for the ''[[Liberatores]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/auggie.htm Augustus (31 BC – 14 AD)] by Garrett G. Fagan. ''De Imperatoribus Romanis''. 5 July 2004. Retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 42&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deified]] Caesar as ''[[Divus Iulius]]''; Octavian thus became ''[[Divi filius]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usask.ca/antiquities/coins/augustus.html Coins of the Emperor Augustus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525075317/http://www.usask.ca/antiquities/coins/augustus.html |date=25 May 2009}}; examples are a coin of 38&amp;nbsp;BC inscribed "Divi Iuli filius", and another of 31&amp;nbsp;BC bearing the inscription "Divi filius" ([http://www2.unine.ch/webdav/site/antic/shared/documents/latin/Memoires/mlreid.pdf ''Auguste vu par lui-même et par les autres'' by Juliette Reid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319090301/http://www2.unine.ch/webdav/site/antic/shared/documents/latin/Memoires/mlreid.pdf |date=19 March 2009}}).&lt;/ref&gt; the son of the deified. In the same year, Octavian and Antony defeated both Caesar's assassins and the leaders of the ''Liberatores'', [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]], in the [[Battle of Philippi]]. The Second Triumvirate was marked by the [[proscription]]s of many senators and ''equites'': after a revolt led by Antony's brother [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], more than 300 senators and ''equites'' involved were executed, although Lucius was spared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#ref53] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XV.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Triumvirate divided the Empire among the triumvirs: Lepidus was given charge of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], Antony, the eastern provinces, and Octavian remained in [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italia]] and controlled [[Hispania]] and [[Gaul]]. The Second Triumvirate expired in 38&amp;nbsp;BC but was renewed for five more years. However, the relationship between Octavian and Antony had deteriorated, and Lepidus was forced to retire in 36&amp;nbsp;BC after betraying Octavian in [[Bellum Siculum|Sicily]]. By the end of the Triumvirate, Antony was living in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], ruled by his lover, [[Cleopatra VII]]. Antony's affair with Cleopatra was seen as an act of treason, since she was queen of another country. Additionally, Antony adopted a lifestyle considered too extravagant and [[Hellenistic]] for a Roman statesman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#ref57] Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Antony'', LXXI, 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Antony's [[Donations of Alexandria]], which [[Reign of Cleopatra VII|gave to Cleopatra]] the title of "[[Queen of Kings]]", and to Antony's and Cleopatra's children the regal titles to the newly conquered Eastern territories, [[War of Actium|war between Octavian and Antony broke out]]. Octavian annihilated Egyptian forces in the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Death of Cleopatra|Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide]]. Now Egypt was conquered by the Roman Empire.

Augustus ({{Reign|27 BC|AD 14}}) gathered almost all the republican powers under his official title, {{lang|la|[[princeps]]}}, and diminished the political influence of the [[Roman Senate|senatorial class]] by boosting the [[equestrian class]]. The senators lost their right to rule certain provinces, like Egypt, since the governor of that province was directly nominated by the emperor. The creation of the [[Praetorian Guard]] and his reforms in the military, creating a [[standing army]] with a fixed size of 28&amp;nbsp;legions, ensured his total control over the army.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Eck, ''The Age of Augustus''&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with the Second Triumvirate's epoch, Augustus' reign as {{lang|la|princeps}} was very peaceful, which led the people and the nobles of Rome to support Augustus, increasing his strength in political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Augustus |volume=2 |page=912 |first=Henry Francis |last=Pelham |author-link=Henry Francis Pelham}}&lt;/ref&gt; His generals were responsible for the field command, gaining such commanders as [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] and [[Germanicus]] much respect from the populace and the legions. Augustus intended to extend the Roman Empire to the whole known world, and in his reign, Rome conquered [[Cantabrian Wars|Cantabria]], [[Aquitania]], [[Raetia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XXI, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Augustus' reign, Roman literature grew steadily in what is known as the [[Golden Age of Latin Literature]]. Poets like [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Lucius Varius Rufus|Rufus]] developed a rich literature, and were close friends of Augustus. Along with [[Maecenas]], he sponsored patriotic poems, such as Virgil's epic ''[[Aeneid]]'' and historiographical works like those of [[Livy]]. Augustus continued the changes to the calendar promoted by Caesar, and the month of August is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus brought a peaceful and thriving era to Rome, known as ''[[Pax Romana]]''.

==== Flavian dynasty ====
[[File:Vespasianus01 pushkin edit.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Bust of [[Vespasian]], founder of the [[Flavian dynasty]]]]
The [[Flavians]] were the second dynasty to rule Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius&lt;/ref&gt; By 68&amp;nbsp;AD, the year of Nero's death, there was no chance of a return to the Republic, and so a new emperor had to arise. After the turmoil in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]] (anglicised as Vespasian) took control of the empire and established a new dynasty. Under the Flavians, Rome continued its expansion, and the state remained secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Connell|1989|page=[https://archive.org/details/ofarmsmenhisto00ocon/page/81 81]}}; {{Cite web |last=Kreis |first=Stephen |title=Augustus Caesar and the Pax Romana |url=http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/lecture12b.html |access-date=21 March 2007 |website=The History Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Trajan, the Roman Empire reached the peak of its territorial expansion.{{Sfn| Scarre|1995}} Rome's dominion now spanned {{Convert|5.0|e6km2|e6mi2|abbr=off|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name="Taagepera-1979" /&gt;

The most significant [[Campaign history of the Roman military|military campaign]] undertaken during the Flavian period was the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|siege and destruction]] of [[Jerusalem]] in 70 AD by [[Titus]]. The destruction of the city was the culmination of the Roman campaign in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] following the Jewish uprising of 66 AD. The Second Temple was completely demolished, after which Titus' soldiers proclaimed him ''[[imperator]]'' in honour of the victory. Jerusalem was sacked and much of the population killed or dispersed. [[Josephus]] claims that 1,100,000 people were killed during the siege, of whom a majority were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, The Wars of the Jews VI.9.3&lt;/ref&gt; 97,000 were captured and [[Slavery in ancient Rome|enslaved]]. Many fled to areas around the Mediterranean.

Vespasian was a general under [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]] and fought as a commander in the [[First Jewish-Roman War]]. Following the turmoil of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], in 69&amp;nbsp;AD, four emperors were enthroned in turn: [[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vitellius]], and, lastly, Vespasian, who crushed Vitellius' forces and became emperor.&lt;ref name="Suetonius"&gt;{{Cite book |last=[[Suetonius]] |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html |title=The Twelve Caesars: Vespasian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reconstructed many buildings which were uncompleted, like a statue of [[Apollo]] and the temple of ''[[Claudius|Divus Claudius]]'' ("the deified Claudius"), both initiated by Nero. Buildings destroyed by the [[Great Fire of Rome]] were rebuilt, and he revitalised the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]]. Vespasian started the construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, commonly known as the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref name="Suetonius" /&gt; The historians [[Josephus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote their works during Vespasian's reign. Vespasian was Josephus' sponsor and Pliny dedicated his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' to Titus, son of Vespasian. Vespasian sent legions to defend the eastern frontier in [[Cappadocia]], extended the occupation in Britannia (modern-day England, Wales and southern [[Scotland]]) and reformed the tax system. He died in 79&amp;nbsp;AD.

Titus became emperor in 79. He finished the Flavian Amphitheater, using war spoils from the First Jewish-Roman War, and hosted victory games that lasted for a hundred days. These games included [[gladiator]]ial combats, horse races and a sensational mock naval battle on the flooded grounds of the Colosseum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#ref7] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVI.; [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#ref9] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Titus'', VII, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Titus died of fever in 81&amp;nbsp;AD, and was succeeded by his brother [[Domitian]].

==== Nerva–Antonine dynasty ====
[[File:RomanEmpireTrajan117AD.png|thumb|The [[Roman Empire]] reached its greatest extent under [[Trajan]] in AD&amp;nbsp;117]]
Following Domitian's murder, the Senate rapidly appointed Nerva as Emperor. Nerva had noble ancestry, and he had served as an advisor to Nero and the Flavians. His rule restored many of the traditional liberties of Rome's upper classes, which Domitian had over-ridden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 68}}; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]] from 96 AD to 192 AD included the "five good emperors" [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]. Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius were part of Italic families settled in Roman colonies outside of Italy: the families of Trajan and Hadrian had settled in [[Italica]] ([[Hispania Baetica]]), that of Antoninus Pius in [[Nîmes|Colonia Agusta Nemausensis]] ([[Gallia Narbonensis]]), and that of Marcus Aurelius in [[Espejo, Spain|Colonia Claritas Iulia Ucubi]] (Hispania Baetica). The Nerva-Antonine dynasty came to an end with [[Commodus]], son of Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of European Peoples |date=2006 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nerva abdicated and died in 98&amp;nbsp;AD, and was succeeded by the general [[Trajan]]. Trajan is credited with the restoration of traditional privileges and rights of commoner and senatorial classes, which later Roman historians claim to have been eroded during Domitian's autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan fought three [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian wars]], winning territories roughly equivalent to modern-day [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. He undertook an ambitious public building program in Rome, including [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Market]] and [[Trajan's Column]], with the architect [[Apollodorus of Damascus]]. He remodelled the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] and extended the [[Circus Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Parthia]] appointed a king for [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] without consulting Rome, Trajan declared [[Trajan's Parthian campaign|war on Parthia]] and deposed the king of Armenia. In 115 he took the Northern Mesopotamian cities of [[Nisibis]] and [[Batnae]], organised a province of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] (116), and issued coins that claimed Armenia and Mesopotamia were under the authority of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 17–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, he captured [[Seleucia]] and the Parthian capital [[Ctesiphon]] (near modern [[Baghdad]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Emperors of Rome: The Story of Imperial Rome from Julius Caesar to the Last Emperor |date=2014 |publisher=Hachette UK |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating a Parthian revolt and a [[Kitos War|Jewish revolt]], he withdrew due to health issues, and in 117, he died of [[edema]].

[[File:Hadrians Wall map.png|thumb|Map showing the location of [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]] in Scotland and Northern England]] Trajan's successor Hadrian withdrew all the troops stationed in Parthia, Armenia and Mesopotamia (modern-day [[Iraq]]), abandoning Trajan's conquests. Hadrian's army crushed a revolt in [[Mauretania]] and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in Judea. This was the last large-scale Jewish revolt against the Romans, and was suppressed with massive repercussions in Judea. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed. Hadrian renamed the province of Judea "[[Provincia Syria Palaestina]]", after one of Judea's most hated enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofch0001unse_t6f2/page/15 |title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4 |date=2005 |publisher=Wm.

Hadrian promoted culture, especially the Greek. He forbade [[torture]] and humanised the laws. His many building projects included aqueducts, baths, libraries and theatres; additionally, he travelled nearly every province in the Empire to review military and infrastructural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html] Historia Augusta, ''Life of Hadrian''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Hadrian's death in 138 AD, his successor [[Antoninus Pius]] built temples, theatres, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]]. On becoming emperor, Antoninus made few initial changes, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by his predecessor. Antoninus expanded Roman Britannia by invading what is now southern Scotland and building the [[Antonine Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Antoninus_Pius*.html#ref34] ''Historia Augusta'', ''Life of Antoninus Pius'', V, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued Hadrian's policy of humanising the laws.

From Nerva to Marcus Aurelius, the empire achieved an unprecedented status. The powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. All the citizens enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence. The Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. Gibbon declared the rule of these "Five Good Emperors" the golden era of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |date=1906 |publisher=Fred de Fau and Co. |editor-last=Bury |editor-first=J.

Retrieved 12 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodus]], son of Marcus Aurelius, became emperor after his father's death. He is not counted as one of the Five Good Emperors, due to his direct kinship with the latter emperor; in addition, he was militarily passive. [[Cassius Dio]] identifies his reign as the beginning of Roman [[decadence]]: "(Rome has transformed) from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust."&lt;ref name="Cassius Dio" /&gt;

==== Severan dynasty ====

Commodus was killed by a conspiracy involving [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]] and his wife Marcia in late 192&amp;nbsp;AD. The following year is known as the [[Year of the Five Emperors]], during which [[Helvius Pertinax]], [[Didius Julianus]], [[Pescennius Niger]], [[Clodius Albinus]] and [[Septimius Severus]] held the imperial dignity. Pertinax, a member of the senate who had been one of Marcus Aurelius's right-hand men, was the choice of Laetus, and he ruled vigorously and judiciously. Laetus soon became jealous and instigated Pertinax's murder by the Praetorian Guard, who then auctioned the empire to the highest bidder, Didius Julianus, for 25,000 sesterces per man.{{Sfn|Cary|1967|page=704}} The people of Rome were appalled and appealed to the frontier legions to save them. The legions of three frontier provinces—[[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Pannonia Superior]], and [[Roman Syria|Syria]]—resented being excluded from the "[[donative]]" and replied by declaring their individual generals to be emperor. Lucius Septimius Severus Geta, the Pannonian commander, bribed the opposing forces, pardoned the Praetorian Guards and installed himself as emperor. He and his successors governed with the legions' support. The changes on [[coin]]age and military expenditures were the root of the financial crisis that marked the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].

Severus was enthroned after invading Rome and having [[Didius Julianus]] killed. Severus attempted to revive totalitarianism and, addressing the Roman people and Senate, praised the severity and cruelty of Marius and Sulla, which worried the senators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/76*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVI, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Parthia]] invaded Roman territory, Severus successfully waged war against that country. Notwithstanding this military success, Severus failed in invading [[Hatra]], a rich Arabian city. Severus killed his legate, who was gaining respect from the legions; and his soldiers fell victim to famine. After this disastrous campaign, he withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/76*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVI, 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus also intended to vanquish the whole of Britannia. To achieve this, he [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208–210|waged war]] against the [[Caledonians]]. However, he became ill and died in 211&amp;nbsp;AD.

His sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] were made emperors. Caracalla had his brother, a youth, assassinated in his mother's arms, and may have murdered 20,000 of Geta's followers. Like his father, Caracalla was warlike. He continued Severus' policy and gained respect from the legions. Knowing that the citizens of [[Alexandria]] disliked him and were denigrating his character, Caracalla served a banquet for its notable citizens, after which his soldiers killed all the guests. From the security of the temple of Sarapis, he then directed an indiscriminate slaughter of Alexandria's people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVIII, 22–23.; [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html#ref35] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Caracalla'', VI.&lt;/ref&gt; In 212, he issued the [[Edict of Caracalla]], giving full Roman citizenship to all free men living in the Empire, with the exception of the ''dediticii'', people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war, and freed slaves.&lt;ref name="Giessen Papyrus"&gt;Giessen Papyrus, 40, 7–9 "I grant to all the inhabitants of the Empire the Roman citizenship and no one remains outside a civitas, with the exception of the dediticii"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrinus]] conspired to have Caracalla assassinated by one of his soldiers during a pilgrimage to the Temple of the Moon in Carrhae, in 217&amp;nbsp;AD. Macrinus assumed power, but soon removed himself from Rome to the east and Antioch. His brief reign ended in 218, when the youngster Bassianus, high priest of the temple of the Sun at Emesa, and supposedly illegitimate son of Caracalla, was declared Emperor by the disaffected soldiers of Macrinus. He adopted the name of Antoninus but history has named him after his Sun god [[Elagabalus]], represented on Earth in the form of a large black stone. An incompetent and lascivious ruler,{{Sfn|Haywood|1971|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientworld0000unse/page/376 376]–393}} Elagabalus adopted his cousin [[Severus Alexander]], as Caesar, but subsequently grew jealous and attempted to assassinate him. However, the Praetorian guard preferred Alexander, murdered Elagabalus, dragged his mutilated corpse through the streets of Rome, and threw it into the Tiber. Severus Alexander then succeeded him. Alexander waged war against many foes, including the revitalised [[Persia]] and also the [[Germanic peoples]], who invaded Gaul. His losses generated dissatisfaction among his soldiers, and some of them murdered him during his Germanic campaign in 235&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Severus_Alexander/3*.html#ref239] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Alexander Severus'', LIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperors were no longer men linked with nobility; they usually were born in lower-classes of distant parts of the Empire. These men rose to prominence through military ranks, and became emperors through civil wars.

There were 26 emperors in a 49-year period, a signal of political instability. [[Maximinus Thrax]] was the first ruler of that time, governing for just three years. Others ruled just for a few months, like [[Gordian I]], [[Gordian II]], [[Balbinus]] and [[Hostilian]]. The population and the frontiers were abandoned, since the emperors were mostly concerned with defeating rivals and establishing their power. The economy also suffered: massive military expenditures from the [[Severan dynasty|Severi]] caused a devaluation of Roman coins. [[Hyperinflation]] came at this time as well. The [[Plague of Cyprian]] broke out in 250 and killed a huge portion of the population.&lt;ref name="Gibbon-1906"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |date=1906 |publisher=Fred de Fau and Co. |editor-last=Bury |editor-first=J.B. |language=en |chapter=Chapter X |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/731/731-h/731-h.htm#link102HCH0001 |chapter-format=Online version}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 260&amp;nbsp;AD, the provinces of [[Syria Palaestina]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Egypt]] separated from the rest of the Roman state to form the [[Palmyrene Empire]], ruled by Queen [[Zenobia]] and centered on [[Palmyra]].

==== Diocletian ====
[[File:DiocletianusFollis-transparent.png|thumb|A Roman {{lang|la|[[follis]]}} depicting the profile of [[Diocletian]]]]
In 284&amp;nbsp;AD, Diocletian was hailed as Imperator by the eastern army. Diocletian healed the empire from the crisis, by political and economic shifts. A new form of government was established: the [[Tetrarchy]]. The Empire was divided among four emperors, two in the West and two in the East. The first tetrarchs were Diocletian (in the East), [[Maximian]] (in the West), and two junior emperors, [[Galerius]] (in the East) and [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]] (in the West). To adjust the economy, Diocletian made several tax reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapter-url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#VII |author=Lactantius |title=De Mortibus Persecutorum |chapter=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian expelled the Persians who plundered Syria and conquered some barbarian tribes with Maximian. He adopted many behaviours of Eastern monarchs. Anyone in the presence of the emperor had now to prostrate himself—a common act in the East, but never practised in Rome before.&lt;ref&gt;Joannes Zonaras, ''Epitome: From Diocletian to the death of Galerius''&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian did not use a disguised form of Republic, as the other emperors since [[Augustus]] had done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/dioclet.htm Diocletian (284–305 AD)] by Ralph W.

After 1200 years of independence and nearly 700 years as a great power, the rule of Rome in the West ended.{{Sfn|Durant|Durant|1944|page=670}} Various reasons for Rome's fall have been proposed, including loss of Republicanism, moral decay, military tyranny, class war, slavery, economic stagnation, environmental change, disease, the decline of the Roman race, as well as the inevitable ebb and flow that all civilisations experience.
The Eastern Empire survived for almost 1000 years after the fall of its [[Western Roman Empire|Western counterpart]] and became the most stable Christian [[realm]] during the Middle Ages. During the 6th century, [[Justinian]] reconquered the Italian peninsula [[Gothic War (535–554)|from the Ostrogoths]], North Africa [[Vandalic War|from the Vandals]], and southern Hispania [[Spania#Conquest and foundation|from the Visigoths]].

=== Law ===
{{Main|Roman law}}
The roots of the legal principles and practices of the [[Outline of ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] may be traced to the [[Law of the Twelve Tables]] promulgated in 449&amp;nbsp;BC and to the codification of law issued by order of Emperor [[Justinian I]] around 530&amp;nbsp;AD (see {{lang|la|[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]}}). Roman law as preserved in Justinian's codes continued into the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Roman Empire]], and formed the basis of similar codifications in continental Western Europe. Roman law continued, in a broader sense, to be applied throughout most of Europe until the end of the 17th century.

The major divisions of the law of ancient Rome, as contained within the Justinian and Theodosian law codes, consisted of {{lang|la|Jus civile}}, {{lang|la|[[Jus gentium]]}}, and {{lang|la|Jus naturale}}. The {{lang|la|Jus civile}} ('citizen law') was the body of common laws that applied to Roman citizens.{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|p=46}} The {{lang|la|[[praetores urbani]]}} ({{sg.}} {{lang|la|Praetor Urbanus}}) were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. The {{lang|la|Jus gentium}} ('law of nations') was the body of common laws that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens.{{Sfn|Duiker|Spielvogel|2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldhistoryto1500duik/page/146 146]}} The {{lang|la|[[praetores peregrini]]}} ({{sg.}} {{lang|la|Praetor Peregrinus}}) were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. {{lang|la|Jus naturale}} encompassed natural law, the body of laws that were considered common to all beings.

=== Class structure ===
{{Main|Social class in ancient Rome|Status in Roman legal system}}
[[File:Arringatore 04.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|''[[The Orator]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;100 BC, from the [[National Archaeological Museum of Florence]], Italy, an Etrusco-Roman bronze statue depicting Aule Metele (Latin: Aulus Metellus), an Etruscan man wearing a Roman [[toga]] while engaged in [[rhetoric]]; the statue features an inscription in the [[Etruscan language]]]]
Roman society is largely viewed as [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]], with [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] ({{lang|la|servi}}) at the bottom, [[freedmen]] ({{lang|la|liberti}}) above them, and free-born citizens ({{lang|la|cives}}) at the top. Free citizens were subdivided by class. The broadest, and earliest, division was between the [[patricians]], who could trace their ancestry to one of the 100 [[patriarch]]s at the founding of the city, and the [[plebeians]], who could not. This became less important in the later Republic, as some plebeian families became wealthy and entered politics, and some patrician families fell economically. Anyone, patrician or plebeian, who could count a consul as his ancestor was a [[nobility|noble]] ({{lang|la|nobilis}}); a man who was the first of his family to hold the consulship, such as [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] or [[Cicero]], was known as a {{lang|la|[[novus homo]]}} ('new man') and ennobled his descendants. Patrician ancestry, however, still conferred considerable prestige, and many religious offices remained restricted to patricians.

A [[class division]] originally based on military service became more important. Membership of these classes was determined periodically by the [[Roman censor|censors]], according to property. The wealthiest were the Senatorial class, who dominated politics and command of the army. Next came the [[Equestrian order|equestrians]] ({{lang|la|[[equites]]}}, sometimes translated "knights"), originally those who could afford a warhorse, and who formed a powerful mercantile class. Several further classes, originally based on the military equipment their members could afford, followed, with the {{lang|la|proletarii}}, citizens who had no property other than their children, at the bottom. Before the reforms of Marius they were ineligible for military service and are often described as being just above freed slaves in wealth and prestige.

Voting power in the Republic depended on class. Citizens were enrolled in voting "tribes", but the tribes of the richer classes had fewer members than the poorer ones, all the {{lang|la|proletarii}} being enrolled in a single tribe. Voting was done in class order, from top down, and stopped as soon as most of the tribes had been reached, so the poorer classes were often unable to cast their votes.

[[Women in ancient Rome]] shared some basic rights with their male counterparts, but were not fully regarded as citizens and were thus not allowed to vote or take part in politics. At the same time the limited rights of women were gradually expanded (due to [[emancipation]]) and women reached freedom from {{lang|la|[[pater familias]]}}, gained property rights and even had more juridical rights than their husbands, but still no voting rights, and were absent from politics.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Frost Abbott, ''Society and Politics in Ancient Rome'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied foreign cities were often given the [[Latin Rights]], an intermediary level between full citizens and foreigners ({{lang|la|peregrini}}), which gave their citizens rights under [[Roman law]] and allowed their leading magistrates to become full Roman citizens. While there were varying degrees of Latin rights, the main division was between those {{lang|la|cum suffragio}} ('with vote'; enrolled in a [[Roman tribe#The Servian tribes|Roman tribe]] and able to take part in the {{lang|la|comitia tributa}}) and {{lang|la|sine suffragio}} ('without vote'; could not take part in Roman politics). Most of Rome's Italian allies were given full citizenship after the [[Social War (91–88&amp;nbsp;BC)|Social War]] of 91–88&amp;nbsp;BC, and full [[Roman citizenship]] was extended to all free-born men in the Empire by [[Caracalla]] in 212, with the exception of the {{lang|la|dediticii}}, people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war, and freed slaves.&lt;ref name="Giessen Papyrus" /&gt;

=== Government ===
{{Main|Roman Constitution|History of the Roman Constitution}}
{{Further|History of citizenship#Roman conceptions of citizenship}}
Initially, Rome was ruled by [[Roman Kingdom|kings]], who were elected from each of Rome's major tribes in turn.{{Sfn|Matyszak|2003|pages=16–42}} The exact nature of the king's power is uncertain. He may have held near-absolute power, or may have merely been the chief executive of the Senate and the people. In military matters, the king's authority ({{lang|la|[[Imperium]]}}) was likely absolute. He was also the head of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|state religion]]. In addition to the authority of the King, there were three administrative assemblies: the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], which acted as an advisory body for the King; the [[Comitia Curiata]], which could endorse and ratify laws suggested by the King; and the [[Roman assemblies|Comitia Calata]], which was an assembly of the priestly college that could assemble the people to bear witness to certain acts, hear proclamations, and declare the [[Festival|feast]] and holiday schedule for the next month.

The [[class struggle]]s of the Roman Republic resulted in an unusual mixture of democracy and [[oligarchy]]. The word republic comes from the Latin {{lang|la|[[res publica]]}}, which literally translates to 'public business'. [[Roman laws]] traditionally could only be passed by a vote of the Popular assembly ([[Comitia Tributa]]). Likewise, candidates for public positions had to run for election by the people. However, the [[Roman Senate]] represented an oligarchic institution, which acted as an advisory body.

In the Republic, the Senate held actual authority ({{lang|la|[[auctoritas]]}}), but no real legislative power; it was technically only an advisory council. However, as the Senators were individually very influential, it was difficult to accomplish anything against the collective will of the Senate. New senators were chosen from among the most accomplished [[patricians]] by [[Roman censor|censors]] ({{lang|la|Censura}}), who could also remove a senator from his office if he was found "morally corrupt". Later, under the reforms of the dictator [[Sulla]], [[quaestor]]s were made automatic members of the Senate, though most of his reforms did not survive.

The Republic had no fixed [[bureaucracy]], and collected taxes through the practice of [[tax farming]]. Government positions such as quaestor, [[aedile]], or [[Prefect|praefect]] were funded by the office-holder. To prevent any citizen from gaining too much power, new [[magistrate]]s were elected annually and had to share power with a colleague. For example, under normal conditions, the highest authority was held by two consuls. In an emergency, a temporary [[Roman dictator|dictator]] could be appointed. Throughout the Republic, the administrative system was revised several times to comply with new demands. In the end, it proved inefficient for controlling the ever-expanding dominion of Rome, contributing to the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]].

In the early Empire, the pretense of a republican form of government was maintained. The [[Roman emperor]] was portrayed as only a {{lang|la|[[princeps]]}}, or 'first citizen', and the Senate gained legislative power and all legal authority previously held by the popular assemblies. However, the rule of the Emperors became increasingly [[autocratic]], and the Senate was reduced to an advisory body appointed by the Emperor. The Empire did not inherit a set bureaucracy from the Republic, since the Republic did not have any permanent governmental structures apart from the Senate. The Emperor appointed assistants and advisers, but the state lacked many institutions, such as a centrally planned budget. Some historians have cited this as a significant reason for the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].

The early [[Roman army]] ({{Circa|500&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=no}}) was, like those of other contemporary [[city-state]]s influenced by Greek civilisation, a citizen {{lang|la|[[militia]]}} that practised [[hoplite]] tactics. It was small and organised in five classes (in parallel to the {{lang|la|[[Roman assemblies|comitia centuriata]]}}, the body of citizens organised politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive.{{Sfn|Keegan|1993|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwarfare00keeg/page/263 263–264]}}&lt;ref name="Potter-2004"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Potter |first=David |title=The Roman Army and Navy |date=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/67 67–70]}} in {{Harvnb|Flower|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of hoplite tactics and their sociocultural setting, see {{Cite book |first=Victor Davis |last=Hanson |title=The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |date=1989 |isbn=0-394-57188-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation in favour of a more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or sometimes 60) men called '{{lang|la|[[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]}} could manoeuvre more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a [[Roman legion|legion]], totalling between 4,000 and 5,000 men.{{Sfn|Keegan|1993|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwarfare00keeg/page/263 263–264]}}&lt;ref name="Potter-2004" /&gt; The early Republican legion consisted of five sections: manipular heavy infantry ({{lang|la|[[hastati]]}}, {{lang|la|[[principes]]}} and {{lang|la|[[triarii]]}}), a force of light infantry ({{lang|la|[[velites]]}}), and the cavalry ({{lang|la|[[equites]]}}). With the new organisation came a new orientation toward the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.{{Sfn|Keegan|1993|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwarfare00keeg/page/263 263–264]}}&lt;ref name="Potter-2004" /&gt;

Until the late Republican period, the typical legionary was a property-owning citizen farmer from a rural area (an {{lang|la|adsiduus}}) who served for particular (often annual) campaigns,{{Efn|Between 343 and 241&amp;nbsp;BC, the Roman army fought in every year but five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Oakley |first=Stephen P. |title=The Early Republic |date=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/27 27]}} in {{Harvnb|Flower|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and who supplied his own equipment. After 200&amp;nbsp;BC, economic conditions in rural areas deteriorated as manpower needs increased, so that the property qualifications for compulsory service were gradually reduced. Beginning in the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC, legionaries were paid a [[stipend]]. By the time of Augustus, the ideal of the citizen-soldier had been abandoned and the legions had become fully professional. At the end of the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Civil War]], Augustus reorganised Roman military forces, discharging soldiers and disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackay|2004|pp=249–250}} Mackay points out that the number of legions grew to 30 by 125&amp;nbsp;AD and 33 during the [[Severan]] period (200–235&amp;nbsp;AD).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Principate]], the tactical organisation of the Army continued to evolve. The {{lang|la|auxilia}} remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new and versatile type of unit, the {{lang|la|cohortes equitatae}}, combined cavalry and legionaries in a single formation. They could be stationed at garrisons or outposts and could fight on their own as balanced small forces or combine with similar units as a larger, legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces.{{Sfn|Goldsworthy|1996|pp=36–37}} The Emperor [[Gallienus]] (253–268&amp;nbsp;AD) began a reorganisation that created the last military structure of the late Empire. Withdrawing some legionaries from the fixed bases on the border, Gallienus created mobile forces (the {{lang|la|[[comitatenses]]}}, or field armies) and stationed them behind and at some distance from the borders as a strategic reserve. The border troops ({{lang|la|[[limitanei]]}}) stationed at fixed bases continued to be the first line of defence. The basic units of the field army were regimental; {{lang|la|legiones}} or {{lang|la|auxilia}} for infantry and {{lang|la|[[vexillation]]es}} for cavalry. Nominal strengths may have been 1,200 men for infantry regiments and 600 for cavalry, but actual troop levels could have been much lower—800 infantry and 400 cavalry.{{Sfn|Elton|1996|pages=89–96}} Many infantry and cavalry regiments operated in pairs under the command of a {{lang|la|[[comes]]}}. Field armies included regiments recruited from allied tribes and known as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}}. By 400&amp;nbsp;AD, {{lang|la|foederati}} regiments had become permanently established units of the Roman army, paid and equipped by the Empire, led by a Roman tribune and used just as Roman units were used. The Empire also used groups of barbarians to fight along with the legions as allies without integration into the field armies, under overall command of a Roman general, but led by their own officers.{{Sfn|Elton|1996|pages=89–96}}

Military leadership evolved over the course of the history of Rome. Under the monarchy, the hoplite armies were led by the kings. During the early and middle Roman Republic, military forces were under the command of one of the two elected [[Roman consul|consuls]] for the year. During the later Republic, members of the Roman Senatorial elite, as part of the normal sequence of elected public offices known as the {{lang|la|[[cursus honorum]]}}, would have served first as {{lang|la|[[quaestor]]}} (often posted as deputies to field commanders), then as {{lang|la|[[praetor]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brennan |first=Correy T. |title=Power and Process Under the Republican 'Constitution' |date=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/66 66–68]}} in {{Harvnb|Flower|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Goldsworthy|1996|pp=121–125}} Following the end of a term as praetor or consul, a Senator might be appointed by the Senate as a {{lang|la|[[propraetor]]}} or {{lang|la|[[proconsul]]}} (depending on the highest office held before) to govern a foreign province. Under Augustus, whose most important political priority was to place the military under a permanent and unitary command, the Emperor was the legal commander of each legion but exercised that command through a {{lang|la|[[legatus]]}} (legate) he appointed from the Senatorial elite. In a province with a single legion, the legate commanded the legion ({{lang|la|[[legatus legionis]]}}) and served as provincial governor, while in a province with more than one legion, each legion was commanded by a legate and the legates were commanded by the provincial governor (also a legate but of higher rank).{{Sfn|Mackay|2004|pp=245–252}}

During the later stages of the Imperial period (beginning perhaps with [[Diocletian]]), the Augustan model was abandoned. Provincial governors were stripped of military authority, and command of the armies in a group of provinces was given to generals ({{lang|la|[[duces]]}}) appointed by the Emperor. These were no longer members of the Roman elite but men who came up through the ranks and had seen much practical soldiering. With increasing frequency, these men attempted (sometimes successfully) to usurp the positions of the Emperors. Decreased resources, increasing political chaos and civil war eventually left the Western Empire vulnerable to attack and takeover by neighbouring barbarian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackay|2004|pp=295–296}} Also chapters 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less is known about the [[Roman navy]] than the Roman army. Prior to the middle of the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC, officials known as {{lang|la|duumviri navales}} commanded a fleet of twenty ships used mainly to control piracy. This fleet was given up in 278&amp;nbsp;AD and replaced by allied forces. The [[First Punic War]] required that Rome build large fleets, and it did so largely with the assistance of and financing from allies. This reliance on allies continued to the end of the Roman Republic. The [[quinquereme]] was the main warship on both sides of the Punic Wars and remained the mainstay of Roman naval forces until replaced by the time of Caesar Augustus by lighter and more manoeuvrable vessels.&lt;ref name="This paragraph is based upon Potter 2004"&gt;This paragraph is based upon {{Harvnb|Potter|2004|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As compared with a [[trireme]], the quinquereme permitted the use of a mix of experienced and inexperienced crewmen (an advantage for a primarily land-based power), and its lesser manoeuvrability permitted the Romans to adopt and perfect [[Corvus (weapon)|boarding tactics]] using a troop of about 40 marines in lieu of the [[Naval tactics in the Age of Galleys|ram]]. Ships were commanded by a {{lang|la|[[navarch]]}}, a rank equal to a centurion, who was usually not a citizen. Potter suggests that because the fleet was dominated by non-Romans, the navy was considered non-Roman and allowed to atrophy in times of peace.&lt;ref name="This paragraph is based upon Potter 2004" /&gt;

Information suggests that by the time of the late Empire (350&amp;nbsp;AD), the Roman navy comprised several fleets including warships and merchant vessels for transportation and supply. Warships were oared sailing galleys with three to five banks of oarsmen. Fleet bases included such ports as Ravenna, Arles, Aquilea, Misenum and the mouth of the Somme River in the West and Alexandria and Rhodes in the East. Flotillas of small river craft ({{lang|la|classes}}) were part of the {{lang|la|limitanei}} (border troops) during this period, based at fortified river harbours along the Rhine and the Danube. That prominent generals commanded both armies and fleets suggests that naval forces were treated as auxiliaries to the army and not as an independent service. The details of command structure and fleet strengths during this period are not well known, although fleets were commanded by prefects.{{Sfn|Elton|1996|pages=99–101}}

=== Economy ===
{{Main|Roman economy|Roman agriculture|Roman commerce|Roman finance|Roman currency|Roman metallurgy}}
[[File:Pompeii - Fullonica of Veranius Hypsaeus 1 - MAN.jpg|thumb|Workers at a cloth-processing shop, in a painting from the {{lang|la|'[[fullonica]]}} of Veranius Hypsaeus in Pompeii]]
Ancient Rome commanded a vast area of land, with tremendous natural and human resources. As such, Rome's economy remained focused on [[Farming in ancient Rome|farming]] and trade. Agricultural [[free trade]] changed the Italian landscape, and by the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, vast grape and [[olive]] estates had supplanted the [[yeoman]] farmers, who were unable to match the imported grain price. The annexation of Egypt, Sicily and [[Tunisia]] in North Africa provided a continuous supply of grains. In turn, [[olive oil]] and [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] were Italy's main exports. Two-tier [[crop rotation]] was practised, but farm productivity was low.

Industrial and manufacturing activities were small. The largest such activities were the mining and [[quarry]]ing of stones, which provided basic construction materials for the buildings of that period. In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some brick factories employed hundreds of workers.

The economy of the early Republic was largely based on [[smallholding]] and paid labour. However, foreign wars and conquests made [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] increasingly cheap and plentiful, and by the late Republic, the economy was largely dependent on [[slave labour]] for both skilled and unskilled work. Slaves are estimated to have constituted around 20% of the Roman Empire's population at this time and 40% in the city of Rome. Only in the Roman Empire, when the conquests stopped and the prices of slaves increased, did hired labour become more economical than slave ownership.

[[File:Mercati di Traiano, 2013.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Trajan's Market]], built by [[Apollodorus of Damascus]]]]
Although [[barter]] was used in ancient Rome, and often used in tax collection, Rome had a very developed coinage system, with brass, bronze, and precious metal coins in circulation throughout the Empire and beyond—some have even been discovered in India. Before the 3rd century&amp;nbsp;BC, copper was traded by weight, measured in unmarked lumps, across [[central Italy]]. The original [[British coinage|copper coins]] ({{lang|la|[[As (Roman coin)|as]]}}) had a face value of one [[Pound (weight)#Origins|Roman pound]] of copper, but weighed less. Thus, Roman money's utility as a unit of exchange consistently exceeded its intrinsic value as metal. After [[Nero]] began debasing the silver [[denarius]], its [[legal tender|legal]] value was an estimated one-third greater than its intrinsic value.

Horses were expensive and other [[pack animal]]s were slower. Mass trade on the [[Roman roads]] connected military posts, where Roman markets were centered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4aX-W6AVNv8C&amp;pg=PA231 |title=The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-78274-6 |editor-last=Sabin |editor-first=Philip |page=231 |editor-last2=van Wees |editor-first2=Hans |editor-last3=Whitby |editor-first3=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; These roads were designed for wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heseltine |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fm5l000EmoAC |title=Roads to Rome |date=2005 |publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum |isbn=978-0-7112-2552-7 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there was transport of [[commodities]] between Roman regions, but increased with the rise of [[Roman commerce#Sea routes|Roman maritime trade]] in the 2nd century BC. During that period, a trading vessel took less than a month to complete a trip from [[Cádiz|Gades]] to [[Alexandria]] via [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], spanning the entire length of the [[Mediterranean]].{{Sfn| Scarre|1995}} Transport by sea was around 60 times cheaper than by land, so the volume for such trips was much larger.

Some economists consider the Roman Empire a [[market economy]], similar in its degree of capitalistic practices to the 17th-century Netherlands and 18th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Temin |first=Peter |year=2001 |title=A Market Economy in the Early Roman Empire |url=http://eh.net/abstracts/archive/0370.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615223139/http://eh.net/abstracts/archive/0370.php |archive-date=15 June 2010 |website=Abstract Archives |publisher=Economy History Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic units of Roman society were households and families.{{Sfn|Duiker|Spielvogel|2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldhistoryto1500duik/page/146 146]}} Groups of households connected through the male line formed a family ({{lang|la|[[gens]]}}), based on blood ties, a common ancestry or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adoption]]. During the Republic, some powerful families, or {{lang|la|[[Gens|Gentes Maiores]]}}, came to dominate political life. Families were headed by their oldest male citizen, the {{lang|la|[[pater familias]]}} (father of the family), who held lawful authority ({{lang|la|patria potestas}}, 'father's power') over wives, sons, daughters, and slaves of the household, and the family's wealth.{{Sfn|Duiker|Spielvogel|2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldhistoryto1500duik/page/146 146]}}

The extreme expressions of this power—the selling or killing of family members for moral or civil offences, including simple disobedience—were very rarely exercised, and were forbidden in the Imperial era. A {{lang|la|pater familias}} had moral and legal duties towards all family members. Even the most despotic {{lang|la|pater familias}} was expected to consult senior members of his household and {{lang|la|gens}} over matters that affected the family's well-being and reputation. Traditionally, such matters were regarded as outside the purview of the state and its magistrates; under the emperors, they were increasingly subject to state interference and legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Tim, &amp; Pomeroy, Arthur, ''Roman Social History, a Sourcebook,'' Routledge, 2007, p. 72. {{ISBN|978-0-4154-2675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accepted into their birth family by their fathers, children were potential heirs. They could not be lawfully given away, or sold into slavery. If parents were unable to care for their child, or if its paternity was in doubt, they could resort to [[infant exposure]] (Boswell translates this as being "offered" up to care by the gods or strangers). If a deformed or sickly newborn was patently "unfit to live", killing it was a duty of the {{lang|la|pater familias}}. A citizen father who exposed a healthy freeborn child was not punished, but automatically lost his {{lang|la|potestas}} over that child. Abandoned children were sometimes adopted; some would have been sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, John Eastburn, "Expositio and Oblatio: The Abandonment of Children and the Ancient and Medieval Family", ''American Historical Review'', '''89''', 1984, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was near-ubiquitous and almost universally accepted. In the early Republic, citizens in debt were allowed to sell their labour, and perhaps their sons, to their debtor in a limited form of slavery called {{lang|la|[[nexum]]}} but this was abolished in the middle Republic. Freedom was considered a natural and proper state for citizens; slaves could [[Manumission|be lawfully freed]], with consent and support of their owners, and still serve their owners' family and financial interests, as freedmen or freed women. This was the basis of the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client-patron relationship]], one of the most important features of Rome's economy and society.{{Sfn|Casson|1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeinan00cass/page/10 10–11], 24–32}}

In law, a {{lang|la|pater familias}} held {{lang|la|potestas}} over his adult sons with their own households. This could give rise to legal anomalies, such as adult sons also having the status of minors. No man could be considered a {{lang|la|pater familias}}, nor could he truly hold property under law, while his own father lived.{{Sfn|Casson|1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeinan00cass/page/10 10–11, 24–32]}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777121908/ Family Values in Ancient Rome] by Richard Saller.

Visited 14 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; During Rome's early history, married daughters came under the control ({{lang|la|manus}}) of their husbands' {{lang|la|pater familias}}. By the late Republic, most married women retained lawful connection to their birth family, though any children from the marriage belonged to her husband's family.{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|pp=39–40}} The mother or an elderly relative often raised both boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rawson |first=Beryl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85Gdul_43DEC&amp;pg=PP7 |title=The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives |date=1987 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-9460-4 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman moralists held that marriage and child-raising fulfilled a basic duty to family, {{lang|la|gens}}, and the state. Multiple remarriages were not uncommon. Fathers usually began seeking husbands for their daughters when these reached an age between twelve and fourteen, but most commoner-class women stayed single until their twenties, and in general seem to have been far more independent than wives of the elite. Divorce required the consent of one party, along with the return of any dowry. Both parents had power over their children during their minority and adulthood, but husbands had much less control over their wives.&lt;ref&gt;Frier, Bruce W., and McGinn, Thomas A. J. ''A Casebook on Roman Family Law'', Oxford University Press: American Philological Association, 2004, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman citizen women held a restricted form of citizenship; they could not vote but were protected by law. They ran families, could own and run businesses, own and cultivate land, write their own wills, and plead in court on their own behalf, or on behalf of others, all under dispensation of the courts and the nominal supervision of a senior male relative. Throughout the late Republican and Imperial eras, a declining birthrate among the elite, and a corresponding increase among commoners was cause of concern for many {{lang|la|gentes}}; [[Augustus]] tried to address this through state intervention, offering rewards to any woman who gave birth to three or more children, and penalising the childless. The latter was much resented, and the former had seemingly negligible results. Aristocratic women seem to have been increasingly disinclined to childbearing.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, Beryl, "The Roman Family", in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'', Cornell University Press, 1986, pp. 30, 40–41.; Galinsky, Karl, ''Augustan Culture: An Interpretive Introduction'', Princeton University Press, 1998, pp. 130–132, {{ISBN|978-0-6910-5890-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time and dates ===
{{See also|Roman timekeeping|Roman calendar|Roman consul#Consular dating}}
Roman hours were counted ordinally from dawn to dawn. Thus, if sunrise was at 6&amp;nbsp;am, then 6 to 7&amp;nbsp;am was called the 'first hour'. Midday was called {{lang|la|meridies}}, and it is from this word that the terms ''am'' ({{lang|la|ante meridiem}}) and ''pm'' ({{lang|la|post meridiem}}) stem. The English word "noon" comes from {{lang|la|nona}} ('ninth (hour)'), which referred to 3&amp;nbsp;pm in ancient Rome.{{Efn|Later in Christian liturgy, "noon" came to describe the [[Nones (liturgy)|nones]], a time of prayer originally at 3&amp;nbsp;pm but later at midday, so "noon" became synonymous with midday.}} The Romans had clocks ({{lang|la|horologia}}), which included giant public [[sundial]]s ({{lang|la|solaria}}) and water clocks ({{lang|la|[[Water clock#Greco-Roman world|clepsydrae]]}}).

The ancient Roman week originally had eight days, which were identified by letters A to H, with the eighth day being the {{lang|la|[[nundinum]]}}, or market day, a kind of weekend when farmers sold their produce on the streets. The [[seven-day week]], introduced from the East during the early Empire, was officially adopted during the reign of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]. Romans [[names of the days of the week|named week days]] after celestial bodies from at least the 1st century&amp;nbsp;AD.

The Roman year originally had ten months from Martius (March) to December, with the winter period not included in the calendar. The first four months were named after gods (Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius) and the others were numbered (Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, November, and December). [[Numa Pompilius]], the second king of Rome (716–673 BC), is said to have introduced the months of January and February, both also named after gods, beginning the 12-month calendar still in use today. In 44&amp;nbsp;BC, the month Quintilis was renamed to Julius (July) after Julius Caesar and in 8&amp;nbsp;BC, Sextilis was renamed to Augustus (August) after Augustus.

The Romans had several ways of tracking years. One widespread way was the [[Roman consul#Consular dating|consular dating]], which identified years by the two [[Roman consul|consuls]] who ruled each year. Another way, introduced in the late 3rd century&amp;nbsp;AD, was counting years from the {{lang|la|[[indiction|indictio]]}}, a 15-year period based on the announcement of the delivery of food and other goods to the government. Another way, less popular but more similar to present day, was {{lang|la|[[ab urbe condita]]}}, which counted years from the mythical foundation of Rome in 753&amp;nbsp;BC.

{{Main|Culture of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Seven Hills of Rome.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[seven hills of Rome]]]]
Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome, located on [[Seven hills of Rome|seven hills]]. The city had a vast number of monumental structures like the [[Colosseum]], the [[Trajan's Forum]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. It had [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], marketplaces, functional sewers, [[thermae|bath complexes]] complete with libraries and shops, and fountains with fresh drinking water supplied by hundreds of miles of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]]. Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential architecture ranged from modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]].

In Rome, there were [[Roman Empire|imperial]] residences on [[Palatine Hill]]. The low [[plebeian]] and middle [[Equestrian order|equestrian]] classes lived in the city center, packed into apartments, or [[Insula (building)|insulae]], which were almost like modern [[ghetto]]s. These areas, often built by upper class property owners to rent, were often centred upon [[collegia]] or [[taberna]]. These people, provided with a [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|free supply of grain]], and entertained by [[gladiator]]ial games, were enrolled as [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients of patrons]] among the upper class [[patricians]], whose assistance they sought and whose interests they upheld.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Latin}}
The native [[language]] of the Romans was [[Latin]], an [[Italic language]] the [[Latin grammar|grammar of which]] relies little on word order, conveying meaning through a system of [[affix]]es attached to [[word stem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/latol-0-X.html Latin Online: Series Introduction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429221355/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/latol-0-X.html |date=29 April 2015 }} by Winfred P.

Retrieved 2 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of Latin could understand both until the 7th century when spoken Latin began to diverge so much that 'Classical' or 'Good Latin' had to be learned as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;József Herman, ''Vulgar Latin'', English translation 2000, pp. 109–114 {{ISBN|978-0-2710-2001-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Latin remained the main written language of the Roman Empire, Greek came to be the language spoken by the well-educated elite, as most of the literature studied by Romans was written in Greek. Most of the emperors were bilingual but had a preference for Latin in the public sphere for political reasons, a practice that first started during the [[Punic wars]].{{Sfnm|Rochette|2023|1pp=263,268|Rochette|2018|2pp=114-115,118}} In the eastern part of the Roman Empire (and later the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]), Latin was never able to replace Greek, a legacy of the [[Hellenistic period]].{{Sfn|Rochette|2018|p=108}} Justinian would be the last emperor to use Latin in government and marks when Greek officially took over.{{Sfnm|1a1=Adkins|1a2=Adkins|1y=1998|1p=203|2a1=Kaldellis|2y=2023|2p=289|3a1=Rochette|3y=2011|3p=562|4a1=Rochette|4y=2023|4p=283}} The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe, and Vulgar Latin evolved into many distinct [[Romance languages]].

Archaic [[Roman religion]], at least concerning the gods, was made up not of written narratives, but rather of complex interrelations between gods and humans.{{Sfn|Matyszak|2003|page=24}} Unlike in [[Greek mythology]], the gods were not personified, but were vaguely defined sacred spirits called {{lang|la|[[numina]]}}. Romans also believed that every person, place or thing had its own {{lang|la|[[genius (mythology)|genius]]}}, or divine soul. During the [[Roman Republic]], [[Roman religion]] was organised under a strict system of priestly offices, which were held by men of senatorial rank. The College of Pontifices was uppermost body in this hierarchy, and its chief priest, the {{lang|la|[[Pontifex Maximus]]}}, was the head of the state religion. [[Flamen]]s took care of the cults of various gods, while [[augur]]s were trusted with taking the [[auspice]]s. The [[Rex Sacrorum|sacred king]] took on the religious responsibilities of the deposed kings. In the Roman Empire, deceased emperors who had ruled well were deified by their successors and the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Gibbon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvIbFyM1s54C&amp;pg=PA91 |title=The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire |publisher=printed for J.J.

As contact with the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] increased, the old [[Roman mythology|Roman gods]] became increasingly associated with [[Greek gods]].{{Sfn|Willis|2000|pages=166–168}} Under the Empire, the Romans absorbed the mythologies of their conquered subjects, often leading to situations in which the temples and priests of traditional Italian deities existed side by side with those of foreign gods.{{Sfn|Willis|2000}}

Beginning with Emperor [[Nero]] in the 1st century AD, Roman official policy towards Christianity was negative, and at some point, being a Christian could be punishable by death. Under Emperor [[Diocletian]], the [[persecution of Christians]] reached its peak. However, it became an officially supported religion in the Roman state under Diocletian's successor, [[Constantine I]], with the signing of the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, and quickly became dominant. All religions except Christianity were prohibited in 391&amp;nbsp;AD by an edict of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/theo1.htm Theodosius I (379–395 AD)] by David Woods.

=== Ethics and morality ===
Like many ancient cultures, concepts of ethics and morality, while sharing some commonalities with modern society, differed greatly in several important ways. Because ancient civilisations like Rome were under constant threat of attack from marauding tribes, their culture was necessarily militaristic with martial skills being a prized attribute.&lt;ref name="Astore, William"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Astore, William |title=Bread and Circuses in Rome and America |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-astore/bread-and-circuses-in-rom_b_3414248.html |access-date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas modern societies consider [[compassion]] a virtue, Roman society considered compassion a vice, a moral defect. One of the primary purposes of the gladiatorial games was to inoculate Roman citizens from this weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87_ImL1ryQ8C |title=Annual Editions: Western Civilization |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2002 |edition=12th |volume=1 |page=68 |quote=... where compassion was regarded as a moral defect ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Astore, William" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jackson, Michael Anthony |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkU9IuW1IuAC |title=Look Back to Get Ahead: Life Lessons from History's Heroes |publisher=Arcade |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-55970-727-5 |page=174 |quote=Gladatorial games were popular because the Romans actually believed that compassion was a vice and a weakness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans instead prized virtues such as courage and conviction ({{lang|la|virtus}}), a sense of duty to one's people, moderation and avoiding excess ({{lang|la|moderatio}}), forgiveness and understanding ({{lang|la|clementia}}), fairness ({{lang|la|severitas}}), and loyalty ({{lang|la|[[pietas]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agyhCwAAQBAJ |title=Daily Life in Ancient Rome: A Sourcebook |publisher=Hackett Publishing Company |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-58510-796-4 |editor-last=Harvey |editor-first=Brian K. |pages=21–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman society had well-established and restrictive norms related to sexuality, though as with many societies, the lion's share of the responsibilities fell on women. Women were generally expected to be monogamous having only a single husband during their life ({{lang|la|univira}}), though this was much less regarded by the elite, especially under the empire. Women were expected to be modest in public avoiding any provocative appearance and to demonstrate absolute fidelity to their husbands ({{lang|la|pudicitia}}). Wearing a veil was a common expectation to preserve modesty. Sex outside of marriage was generally frowned upon for men and women and was made illegal during the imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Langlands, Rebecca |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBLnttutuOMC |title=Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-85943-1 |pages=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, prostitution was an accepted and regulated practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Mathew Dillon |author2=Lynda Garland |author2-link=Lynda Garland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMNL0jqhygoC |title=Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-22459-8 |page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public demonstrations of death, violence, and brutality were used as a source of entertainment in Roman communities; however it was also a way to maintain social order, demonstrate power, and signify communal unity.

Roman painting styles show [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influences, and surviving examples are primarily [[fresco]]es used to adorn the walls and ceilings of [[Villa rustica|country villas]], though Roman literature includes mentions of paintings on wood, [[ivory]], and other materials.{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|pp=350–352}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropt/hd_ropt.htm Roman Painting] from Timeline of Art History. Department of Greek and Roman Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 2004–10. Retrieved 22 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples of Roman painting have been found at [[Pompeii]], and from these art historians divide the history of Roman painting into [[Pompeian Styles|four periods]].

The first style of Roman painting was practised from the early 2nd century BC to the early- or mid-1st century BC. It was mainly composed of imitations of [[marble]] and [[masonry]], though sometimes including depictions of mythological characters.
The second style began during the early 1st century BC and attempted to depict realistically three-dimensional architectural features and landscapes. The third style occurred during the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 14&amp;nbsp;AD), and rejected the [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] of the second style in favour of simple ornamentation. A small architectural scene, landscape, or abstract design was placed in the center with a [[monochrome]] background. The fourth style, which began in the 1st century AD, depicted scenes from mythology, while retaining architectural details and abstract patterns.

Portrait sculpture used youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and [[idealism]]. During the [[Antonine]] and [[Severan]] periods, ornate hair and bearding, with deep cutting and drilling, became popular. Advancements were also made in [[relief]] sculptures, usually depicting Roman victories.

[[Roman music]] was largely based on [[Music of ancient Greece|Greek music]], and played an important part in many aspects of Roman life.&lt;ref name="Grout-1988"&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Donald Jay |last1=Grout |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ise5AAAAIAAJ |title=A history of western music |first2=Claude V. |last2=Palisca |date=1988 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-95627-6 |access-date=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman military]], musical instruments such as the {{lang|la|tuba}} (a long trumpet) or the {{lang|la|cornu}} were used to give various commands, while the {{lang|la|[[buccina]]}} (possibly a trumpet or horn) and the {{lang|la|[[lituus]]}} (probably an elongated J-shaped instrument), were used in ceremonial capacities.{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|p=89}} Music was used in the [[Roman amphitheatre]]s between fights and in the {{lang|la|[[odeon (building)|odea]]}}, and in these settings is known to have featured the {{lang|la|cornu}} and the {{lang|la|[[hydraulis]]}} (a type of water organ).{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|pp=349–350}} Most religious rituals featured musical performances.{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|p=300}} Some music historians believe that music was used at almost all public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Grout-1988" /&gt;

The [[graffiti]], [[brothel]]s, paintings, and sculptures found in [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] suggest that the Romans had a sex-saturated culture.{{Sfn|Grant|2005|pages=130–134}}

==== Literature and libraries ====
[[Latin literature]] was, from its start, influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest extant works are of historical [[Epic poetry|epics]] telling the early military history of Rome. As the Republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and [[tragedy]].

Ancient Rome's literary contributions are still recognised today and the works by ancient Roman authors were available in bookshops as well as in public and private libraries. Many scholars and statesmen of ancient Rome cultivated private libraries that were used both as demonstrations of knowledge and displays of wealth and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dix |first=T.

Although Julius Caesar had intended to establish public libraries to further establish Rome as a great cultural center like Athens and Alexandria, he died before this was accomplished. Caesar's former lieutenant, [[Gaius Asinius Pollio]], took up the project and opened the first public library in Rome in the [[Atrium Libertatis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, BOOK XXXV.

Ancient Roman cuisine changed over the long duration of this ancient civilisation. Dietary habits were affected by the influence of Greek culture, the political changes from [[Roman Kingdom|Kingdom]] to [[Roman Republic|Republic]] to [[Roman Empire|Empire]], and the Empire's enormous expansion, which exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning the differences between social classes were relatively small, but disparities evolved with the Empire's growth. Men and women drank wine with their meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Civitello |first=Linda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uaRl9ZUtBYkC&amp;q=cuisine%20of%20ancient%20rome&amp;pg=PR8 |title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People |date=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-40371-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Roman diet included many items that are staples of [[Italian cuisine|modern Italian cooking]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] discussed more than 30 varieties of [[olive]], 40 kinds of pear, [[Ficus|figs]] (native and imported from Africa and the eastern provinces), and a wide variety of vegetables, including carrots (of different colours, but not orange&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Pray Bober, ''Art, Culture, and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy'', University of Chicago Press (2001), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as [[celery]], garlic, some [[flower bulb]]s, [[cabbage]] and other [[brassica]]s (such as [[kale]] and [[broccoli]]), lettuce, [[endive]], onion, [[leek]], [[asparagus]], [[radish]]es, [[turnip]]s, [[parsnip]]s, [[beet]]s, [[green peas]], [[chard]], [[cardoon]]s, olives, and [[cucumber]].&lt;ref name="Patrick Faas"&gt;Patrick Faas, ''Around the Roman Table: Food and Feasting in Ancient Rome'', University of Chicago Press (2005), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some foods now considered characteristic of modern Italian cuisine were not used.&lt;ref name="Phyllis Pray Bober"&gt;Phyllis Pray Bober, ''Art, Culture, and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy'', University of Chicago Press (2001), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[spinach]] and [[eggplant]] (aubergine) were introduced later from the [[Arab world]], and tomatoes, potatoes, [[capsicum]] peppers, and maize (the modern source of [[polenta]])&lt;ref name="Patrick Faas" /&gt; only appeared in Europe following the discovery of the [[New World]] and the [[Columbian Exchange]].&lt;ref name="Phyllis Pray Bober" /&gt; The Romans knew of rice, but it was very rarely available to them. There were also few [[citrus]] fruits.&lt;ref name="Phyllis Pray Bober" /&gt;

Butcher's meat such as beef was an uncommon luxury. The most popular meat was pork, especially [[sausage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, ''A History of Food'', John Wiley &amp; Sons (2009), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish was more common than meat, with a sophisticated [[aquaculture]] and large-scale industries devoted to [[oyster farming]]. The Romans also engaged in [[snail farming]] and oak grub farming. Some fish were greatly esteemed and fetched high prices, such as [[mullet (fish)|mullet]] raised in the fishery at [[Cosa]], and "elaborate means were invented to assure its freshness".&lt;ref&gt;John E. Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City'', JHU Press (1988), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, a breakfast called {{lang|la|ientaculum}}&lt;ref name="Artman-2"&gt;Artman, John: "Ancient Rome- Independent Learning Unit", page 26, Good Apple, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; was served at dawn. At mid-day to early afternoon, Romans ate {{lang|la|[[cena]]}},&lt;ref name="Artman-2" /&gt; the main meal of the day, and at nightfall a light supper called {{lang|la|vesperna}}.&lt;ref name="Artman"&gt;Artman, John: "Ancient Rome- Independent Learning Unit", p. 26, Good Apple,1991.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased importation of foreign foods, the {{lang|la|cena}} grew larger in size and included a wider range of foods. Thus, it gradually shifted to the evening, while the {{lang|la|vesperna}}&lt;ref name="Artman" /&gt; was abandoned completely over the course of the years. The mid-day meal {{lang|la|prandium}} became a light meal to hold one over until {{lang|la|cena}}.&lt;ref name="Artman-2" /&gt;

The [[toga]], a common garment during the era of Julius Caesar, was gradually abandoned by all social classes of the Empire. At the early 4th century, the toga had become just a garment worn by senators in Senate and ceremonial events. At the 4th century, the toga was replaced by the {{lang|la|[[paenula]]}} (a garment similar to a poncho) as the everyday garment of the Romans, from the lower classes to the upper classes. Another garment that was popular among the Romans in the later years of the [[Western Roman Empire]] was the {{lang|la|[[Pallium (Roman cloak)|pallium]]}}, which was mostly worn by philosophers and scholars in general. Due to external influences, mainly from the Germanic peoples, the Romans adopted [[tunic]]s very similar to those used by the Germanic peoples with whom they interacted in the final years of the Western Empire, also adopted trousers and hats like the {{lang|la|[[Pileus (hat)|pileus pannonicus]]}}. During the Late Empire, the {{lang|la|[[paludamentum]]}} (a type of military clothing) was used only by the Emperor of Rome (since the reign of Augustus, the first emperor) while the [[dalmatic]] (also used by the Christian clergy) began to spread throughout the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/dalmatica/ |title=Dalmatica |access-date=12 August 2023 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play for boys was supposed to prepare them for active military service, such as [[jumping]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], and [[racing]].{{Sfn|Casson|1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeinan00cass/page/98 98–108]}} In the countryside, pastimes for the wealthy also included fishing and hunting.&lt;ref name="SPQR Online-1998"&gt;{{Cite web |year=1998 |title=Daily Life: Entertainment |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/26602/entertainment.htm#leisure |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430025620/http://library.thinkquest.org/26602/entertainment.htm |archive-date=30 April 2007 |website=SPQR Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans also had several forms of ball playing, including one resembling [[American handball|handball]].{{Sfn|Casson|1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeinan00cass/page/98 98–108]}} [[Dice game]]s, [[board game]]s, and [[gamble games]] were popular pastimes.{{Sfn|Casson|1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeinan00cass/page/98 98–108]}} For the wealthy, dinner parties presented an opportunity for entertainment, sometimes featuring music, dancing, and poetry readings.{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|pp=350–352}} The majority, less well-off, sometimes enjoyed similar parties through clubs or associations, but for most Romans, recreational dining usually meant patronising [[tavern]]s.{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|pp=350–352}} Children entertained themselves with toys and such games as [[leapfrog]].&lt;ref name="SPQR Online-1998" /&gt;{{Sfn|Adkins|Adkins|1998|pp=350–352}}

Public games and spectacles were sponsored by leading Romans who wished to advertise their generosity and court popular approval; in Rome or its provinces, this usually meant the emperor or his governors. Venues in Rome and the provinces were developed specifically for public games. Rome's [[Colisseum]] was built in 70 AD under the Roman emperor Vespasian and opened in 80 AD to host other events and [[gladiator]]ial combats. Gladiators sometimes fought to the death, but more often to an adjudicated victory, usually in keeping with the mood of the watching crowd. Shows of exotic animals were popular in their own right; but sometimes animals were pitted against human beings, either armed professionals or unarmed criminals who had been condemned to public death.

[[Chariot racing]] was extremely popular among all classes. In Rome, these races were usually held at the [[Circus Maximus]], which had been purpose-built for chariot and horse-racing and, as Rome's largest public place, was also used for festivals and animal shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/circusmaximus/circusmaximus.html Circus Maximus]. Encyclopedia Romana. University of Chicago. Retrieved 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It could seat around 150,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;John Humphrey, ''Roman circuses: arenas for chariot racing'', University of California Press, 1986, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pont du Gard 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pont du Gard]] in France is a [[Roman aqueduct]] built in c.&amp;nbsp;19&amp;nbsp;BC. It is a [[World Heritage Site]].]]
Ancient Rome boasted impressive technological feats, using many advancements that were lost in the [[Middle Ages]] and not rivalled again until the 19th and 20th centuries. An example of this is [[insulated glazing]], which was not invented again until the 1930s. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier Greek designs. Advancements were often divided and based on craft. [[trade (profession)|Artisans]] guarded technologies as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Roman laws protected against a person corrupting slaves to obtain secrets about the master's arts. {{Cite book |last=Zeidman |first=Bob |url=https://archive.org/details/softwareipdetect00zeid_321 |title=The Software IP Detective's Handbook: : Measurement, Comparison, and Infringement Detection |date=2011 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-703533-5 |edition= |page=[https://archive.org/details/softwareipdetect00zeid_321/page/n129 103] |url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Roman engineering|Roman civil engineering]] and [[Roman military engineering|military engineering]] constituted a large part of Rome's technological superiority and legacy, and contributed to the construction of hundreds of [[Roman road|roads]], [[Roman bridge|bridges]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]] and [[Roman amphitheatre|arenas]]. Many monuments, such as the [[Colosseum]], [[Pont du Gard]], and [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], remain as testaments to Roman engineering and culture.

The Romans were renowned for their [[Roman architecture|architecture]], which is grouped with Greek traditions into "[[Classical architecture]]". Although there were many differences from [[Greek architecture]], Rome borrowed heavily from Greece in adhering to strict, formulaic building designs and proportions. Aside from two new [[classical order|orders]] of columns, [[composite order|composite]] and [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], and from the [[dome]], which was derived from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[arch]], Rome had relatively few architectural innovations until the end of the Republic.

In the 1st century BC, Romans started to use [[Roman concrete]] widely. Concrete was [[Roman architectural revolution|invented]] in the late 3rd century BC. It was a powerful cement derived from [[pozzolana]], and soon supplanted [[marble]] as the chief Roman building material and allowed many daring architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Winter |first=Thomas Nelson |date=1979 |title=Roman Concrete: The Ascent, Summit, and Decline of an Art |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/classicsfacpub/1 |journal=Transactions of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences |volume=7 |pages=137–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1st century BC, [[Vitruvius]] wrote {{lang|la|[[De architectura]]}}, possibly the first complete treatise on architecture in history.

The Romans also largely built using timber, causing a rapid decline of the woodlands surrounding Rome. The first evidence of long-distance wood trading come from the discovery of wood planks, felled between AD 40 and 60, coming from the Jura mountains in northeastern France and ending up more than {{Convert|1055|miles|-1}} away, in the foundations of a lavish portico that was part of a vast wealthy patrician villa, in Central Rome. It is suggested that timber, around {{Convert|4|metres}} long, came up to Rome via the Tiber River on ships travelling across the Mediterranean Sea from the confluence of the [[Saône]] and [[Rhône]] rivers in what is now the city of [[Lyon]] in present-day France.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

[[File:Appia antica 2-7-05 048.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Appian Way]] ({{lang|la|Via Appia}}), a road connecting the city of Rome to the southern parts of Italy, remains usable even today]]
With solid foundations and good drainage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Roman road system |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/Roman-road-system |access-date=19 August 2017 |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman roads]] were known for their durability and many segments of the Roman road system were still in use a thousand years after the fall of Rome. The construction of a vast and efficient travel network throughout the Empire dramatically increased Rome's power and influence. They allowed [[Roman legion]]s to be deployed rapidly, with predictable marching times between key points of the empire, no matter the season.{{Sfn|Keegan|1993|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwarfare00keeg/page/303 303]}} These highways also had enormous economic significance, solidifying Rome's role as a trading crossroads—the origin of the saying "all roads lead to Rome". The Roman government maintained a system of way stations, known as the {{lang|la|[[cursus publicus]]}}, and established a system of horse relays allowing a dispatch to travel up to {{Convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} a day.

The Romans constructed numerous [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to supply water to cities and industrial sites and to aid in [[Roman agriculture|their agriculture]]. By the third century, the city of Rome was supplied by [[List of aqueducts in the city of Rome|11 aqueducts]] with a combined length of {{Convert|450|km|0|abbr=on}}. The Romans also made major advancements in sanitation. Romans were particularly famous for their public baths, called {{lang|la|[[thermae]]}}, which were used for both hygienic and social purposes. Many Roman houses had [[flush toilet]]s and [[indoor plumbing]], and a complex [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] system, the {{lang|la|[[Cloaca Maxima]]}}, was used to drain the local marshes and carry waste into the Tiber. Some historians have speculated that lead pipes in the sewer and plumbing systems led to widespread [[lead poisoning]], which contributed to [[fall of Rome]]; however, lead content would have been minimised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Duckworth |isbn=978-0-7156-2194-3 |title=Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply |first=A.T. |last=Hodge |date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Grout |first=James |title=Lead Poisoning and Rome |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526104339/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html |archive-date=26 May 2012 |access-date=22 July 2011 |publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this loss, there are gaps in Roman history, which are filled by unreliable works, such as the ''{{lang|la|[[Historia Augusta]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html] Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Marius'', XI, 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caesar]] wrote his own accounts of his military campaigns in [[Gaul]] and during the [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil War]] in part to impress his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Handford |first=S. A. |title=Caesar: The Conquest of Gaul |publisher=Penguin |year=1951 |location=Harmondsworth |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Empire, the biographies of famous men and early emperors flourished, examples being ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' of Suetonius, and Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives]]''. Other major works of Imperial times were that of Livy and Tacitus.
* [[Polybius]] – ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]''
